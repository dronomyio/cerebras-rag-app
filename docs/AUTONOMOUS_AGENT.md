# Autonomous Agent for Cerebras RAG Application

This document provides an overview of the autonomous agent capabilities added to the Cerebras RAG application.

## Overview

The Cerebras RAG application has been enhanced with autonomous agent capabilities, transforming it from a reactive question-answering system into a proactive AI agent with planning, memory, and decision-making capabilities. This autonomous agent can:

1. Set and pursue goals independently
2. Break down complex tasks into actionable steps
3. Make decisions about what information to retrieve
4. Learn from past interactions to improve future performance
5. Monitor its own operation and adapt as needed

## Architecture

The autonomous agent is built on a modular architecture with four core components:

### 1. Planning Module

The planning module is responsible for:
- Creating plans to achieve user-defined goals
- Breaking down goals into manageable tasks
- Tracking task dependencies and execution order
- Adapting plans when circumstances change

### 2. Memory Module

The memory module provides:
- Working memory for current tasks and context
- Episodic memory for past events and interactions
- Semantic memory for factual knowledge
- Memory retrieval based on relevance to current goals

### 3. Decision Module

The decision module handles:
- Action selection based on current state and goals
- Utility calculation for different possible actions
- Reasoning about the best approach to a problem
- Evaluating the results of actions

### 4. Monitoring Module

The monitoring module enables:
- Performance tracking across various metrics
- Error detection and handling
- Self-reflection and improvement
- Anomaly detection in system behavior

## Integration with RAG

The autonomous agent is fully integrated with the existing RAG application:

1. **Document Processing**: The agent can trigger document processing and ingestion
2. **Vector Search**: The agent can perform semantic searches based on its current goals
3. **Code Execution**: The agent can execute code to analyze data or perform calculations
4. **Response Generation**: The agent can generate responses using the Cerebras API

## Usage

### Setting Goals

You can set goals for the agent through the web interface:

```python
# Example of setting a goal programmatically
from agent_core.integration import AgentIntegration

integration = AgentIntegration("config/agent_config.json")
goal_id = integration.set_goal(
    description="Research financial engineering concepts in Ruppert's book",
    priority=3,
    deadline="2025-06-01T00:00:00Z"
)
```

### Monitoring Agent Status

You can monitor the agent's status and performance:

```python
# Get agent status
status = integration.get_agent_status()
print(f"Agent running: {status['running']}")
print(f"Active goals: {status['goals']['active']}")
print(f"Performance: {status['performance']}")
```

### Configuration

The agent is highly configurable through the `agent_config.json` file:

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "name": "Cerebras RAG Agent"
  },
  "planning": {
    "max_plan_steps": 10,
    "adaptation_threshold": 0.7
  },
  "memory": {
    "working_memory_capacity": 100,
    "episodic_memory_capacity": 1000
  },
  "decision": {
    "default_utility_threshold": 0.5,
    "exploration_rate": 0.1
  },
  "monitoring": {
    "performance_tracking_enabled": true,
    "reflection_interval": 100
  },
  "unstructured": {
    "enabled": true
  }
}
```

## Benefits

The autonomous agent provides several key benefits:

1. **Proactive Research**: The agent can proactively research topics rather than just responding to queries
2. **Continuous Learning**: The agent improves over time through its memory and self-reflection
3. **Complex Task Handling**: The agent can handle multi-step tasks that require planning
4. **Adaptability**: The agent can adapt to changing requirements and new information
5. **Self-Monitoring**: The agent can detect and address issues in its own operation

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements include:

1. Multi-agent collaboration for complex tasks
2. Enhanced learning capabilities through reinforcement learning
3. More sophisticated planning algorithms
4. Integration with additional external tools and APIs
5. Improved natural language understanding for goal setting
